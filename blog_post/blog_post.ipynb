    "Summary: Machine learning models are being used to make ever more important decisions in the modern world. Because of the power of data modeling, ML models are able to learn the nuances of a domain and make accurate predictions even in situations where a human expert would not be able to. However, ML models are not omniscient and they should not run without oversight from their operators. To handle situations in which we don't want to have an ML model make predictions, we can create a policy that steps in before the prediction is returned to the user. A policy that is applied to an ML model is simply a rule that ensures that the model will never make predictions that are unsafe to use. For example, we can create a policy that make sure that a machine learning model that makes predictions about optimal airline ticket prices never makes predictions that cost the airline money. A good policy for an ML model is one that allows the model some leeway while also ensuring that the model’s predictions are safe to use. In this blog post, we'll write policies for ML models and deploy the policies alongside the model using the decorator pattern."

    "\n",
    "In a [previous blog post](https://www.tekhnoal.com/ml-model-decorators.html) we introduced the decorator pattern for ML model deployments and then showed how to use the pattern to build extensions for a deployed model. For example, in [this blog post](https://www.tekhnoal.com/data-enrichment-for-ml-models.html) we added data enrichment to a deployed model. In [this blog post](https://www.tekhnoal.com/caching-for-ml-models.html) we added prediction caching to a deployed model. These extensions were added without having to modify the machine learning model prediction code at all, we were able to do it using the [decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern). In this blog post we’ll add policies to a deployed model in the same way.\n",

    "\n",
    "A policy is a system of guidelines that are used to make decisions. A software-defined policy is simply a policy that is written as code and can be executed. Most of the time, the policies followed by a software system are hard-coded into the system using whichever programming language the system is written in. This is often good enough for, but sometimes the policies are complex enough or change often enough to warrant writing them in a specialized language that is specifically designed for policies. By writing policies separately from the system that they will work in, we can decouple them from the system and make the system simpler to work in. Policies can also be written by domain experts and more easily integrated into the software system in this way.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this blog post we'll write policies for a deployed machine learning model, and we'll use the [Rego policy language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/). Policy decisions are made by querying policies written in Rego that are executed by the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) which is a service that can be integrated into software systems. Other services can offload policy management and execution to the OPA service, accessing it through an RESTful API. The OPA service is specifically built for low-latency evaluations of policies. Rego and OPA are already used to review [Kubernetes manifests](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/kubernetes-introduction/) for best practices, to review infrastructure deployments by [checking Terraform plans](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/terraform/), and to check for authorization within the [Envoy service mesh](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post we’ll also build a decorator that applies policies to the input and output of a model by using the OPA service. By using the decorator pattern that we’ve shown in previous blog posts, we’ll be able to show how to integrate policies separately from the model itself. We'll show how to deploy the ML model inside of a RESTful service along with the decorator, all by modifying a simple configuration file."

    "\n",
    "[Rego policies](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) are assertions on data, in this blog post that data is the ML model's input and output data structures. Using the Insurance Charges Model we installed above, we'll create a policy for this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Smokers over the age of 60 should not have a prediction made.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This policy is completely made up, its an example of a situation in which we would not want to return a prediction from the model for reasons other than the model's capabilities. The prediction that the model makes would still be valid because the model is capable of prediting the insurance chages for a 62 year old smoker, but business requirements may prevent the prediction from being used. This is a good place to add a policy that will enforce this business requirement. The policy looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "package insurance_charges_model\n",
    "\n",
    "customer_is_a_smoker_over_60 if {\n",
    "\tinput.model_input.smoker\n",
    "    input.model_input.age > 60\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is defined in the \"insurance_charges_model\" package. The policy is using the model input fields \"smoker\" which is a boolean field, and \"age\" which is an integer. The value \"customer_is_a_smoker_over_60\" is set to \"true\" if the conditions in the body of the rule are true. This policy is very simple and it does not actually make a decision about what to do with the model's prediction, all it does is detect whether the customer is a smoker over the age of 60. To create a decision we'll add another rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "allow := true if {\n",
    "\tnot customer_is_a_smoker_over_60\n",
    "} else := false {\n",
    "\tcustomer_is_a_smoker_over_60\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've added a rule called \"allow\" to the policy. Very simply, the value for \"allow\" is set to true if the customer is not a smoker over the age of of 60, otherwise it is set to false. We'll use this rule to actually make a decision as to what to do with the prediction. It would also be nice to have a description as to why the decision was made, so we'll add one last rule to the insurance_charges_model policy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "messages contains msg if {\n",
    "\tcustomer_is_a_smoker_over_60\n",
    "    msg:= \"Prediction cannot be made if customer is a smoker over the age of 60.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last rule creates a \"messages\" array with explanations for the rules. If the \"customer_is_a_smoker_over_60\" rule is true, the messages array will contain an explanation for that particular decision. The structure of this policy package is designed to be extendable, so extra clauses can be added to the \"allow\" rule and \"messages\" rule as needed.\n",

    "In this blog post we showed how to deploy a machine learning model with a decorator that applied policies to the model's prediction. We built the policy using the Rego language and executed it with the Open Policy Agent. By adding the policy as a decorator, we’re able to decouple the model’s prediction logic from the policy logic, this makes both components more reusable and easier to test. In fact, the policy decorator can easily be reused in other ML deployments, as long as we write a policy that matches our model’s needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "By writing the policy in an industry-standard language we’re enabling people that don’t have experience with ML or ML deployments to create complex policies that can be deployed alongside an ML model. The person that writes these policies is often a subject matter expert that understands the domain within which the model is working and the effect that the model’s operation will have on it. By using a policy-based approach to the problem of checking ML model predictions we’re able to simplify the deployment process as well, since a policy can be developed and deployed separately from the ML model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the OPA sidecar to the deployment increased the complexity of the software because we have to worry about deploying an extra container in the Kubernetes pod to run the policy. This approach also increased the latency for each prediction because it requires inter-process communication to execute the policy for each prediction that the model service makes. For both of these reasons, using Rego and the Open Policy Agent may not be the ideal choice for all model deployments. In some situations, it may be better to just write the policy in Python and deploy it as a decorator alongside the model, this will make the policy decision add less time to the total prediction time."
